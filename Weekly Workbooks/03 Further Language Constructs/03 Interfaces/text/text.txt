As we have discussed previously, some shapes have a number of variants,
whilst others (such as Circles) have only one. 
It would be useful to have some kind of "marker" that indicates
whether or not a particular shape has multiple variants.

One way to do this is using a Java **Interface** - this is a mechanism, independent of the class hierarchy,
that allows us to "mark" classes as having particular characteristics. You can think of an Interface as a "contract"
that the class "conforms to" - guaranteeing to provide certain properties and features.
Take a look at the slides and video above for more detailed information about interfaces.

As an illustration of interfaces in action, we have provided a `MultiVariantShape` interface in the Maven
project that can be used to indicate that a shape has more than one variant.
We can mark our `Triangle` class as a shape which has multiple variants by updating the class definition
so that it `implements` the `MultiVariantShape` interface:
``` java
class Triangle extends TwoDimensionalShape implements MultiVariantShape
```
This indicates that the `Triangle` class conforms to the properties and features of the `MultiVariantShape` interface.

Elsewhere in our code, we can check to see if a particular object conforms to an interface by using the `instanceof` keyword
Note that this is not a particularly suitable name - it is part of Java and is used for other purposes (where the name does make sense !).
We can check any shape object to see if it implements the `MultiVariantShape` interface using the following code:
``` java
if(shape instanceof MultiVariantShape) System.out.println("This shape has multiple variants")
else System.out.println("This shape has only one variant")
```

Try creating a number of different types of shape (Circles, Rectangles, Triangles etc) and check each to see if it
implements the `MultiVariantShape` using the `instanceof` keyword. Again, you might like to write a JUnit test method to
formally test this functionality.

You may have noticed that the `MultiVariantShape` interface defines a method called `getVariant`
that should return the particular variant of a shape. This allows code outside of the class to interrogate an instance
in order to find out which variant it is. You will also notice that in the interface definition, their is no code that
provides an implementation of this method - it your job as the programmer's to write this !
Luckily you wrote this method during the previous workbook, so it is therefore a quick and an easy job to implement
the `MultiVariantShape` interface in your Triangle class at this stage !
