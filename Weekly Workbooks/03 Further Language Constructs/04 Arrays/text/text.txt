Common to most programming languages, Java provides an **array** data structure (similar in many ways to that found in C). In Java, arrays can hold primitives
(e.g. `int`, `float`, `char`, `boolean` etc) or alternatively complex Objects (such as `Strings`, `Robots` or even `Triangles`) !

Take a look at the slides and video above for more information on using arrays in Java.
Then (in your main method) create an array of size 100 that can hold `TwoDimensionalShapes`.
Fill this array with randomly chosen shapes (`Circles`, `Rectangles`, `Triangles`).
In order to randomly select a shape from those available, you may like to make use of the
Java `Math.random()` method. This will return a randomly selected double precision floating point
number (somewhere between 0.0 and 1.0). You will need to write an IF statement and use some cunning maths
to look at this number and decide which shape to create.

Once you have filled the array with 100 random shapes, loop through it and print out the details of each shape in turn.
At the end of your main method, print out a summary of how many `Triangles` were in the array.
In order to do this, you will need to make use of an integer counter variable to keep a tally of the number of triangles encountered.
You will also need to make use of the `instanceof` operator to check the type of each instance in the array.
Notice how this use of `instanceof` is much more logical than the previous use of the keyword - we are using it to identify the
class which each object is an instance of !
