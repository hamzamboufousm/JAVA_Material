As a final topic for this workbook, let us think about the challenging concept of _multiple_ inheritance.
In some situations it might be useful for a class to have _multiple_ parents/superclasses.
This would allow it to derive methods and attributes from numerous different sources.
This is however dangerous - take a look at the slides and video above to find out why !

Java's solution to this is to only allow single inheritance :o(  
But to augment this with **interfaces** :o)  

Although a bit of a compromise, this combination of features allows us to gain _some_ of the benefits of multiple inheritance, whilst at the same time avoiding many of the main pitfalls.
