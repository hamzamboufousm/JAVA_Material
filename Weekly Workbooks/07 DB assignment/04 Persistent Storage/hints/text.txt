As a useful starting point, your first task is to write a method that reads in the data from the
<a href="resources/people.tab" target="_blank">sample data file</a> using the Java File IO API.
View the slides and video at the start of this section for an overview of these packages.
At this stage you need only print out the content of these records to the terminal
(in a later task you will store this data in a suitable data structure). You may need to delve more deeply into the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/io/package-summary.html" target="_blank">File IO documentation</a>
in order to implement your ideas.

When working with file paths, it is **essential** that you do not use any platform-specific file separators.
Some platforms use `\` and some platforms use `/` for separating folder names in a file path.
Java code should work on ALL platforms - for this reason, you should make use of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html#separator" target="_blank">File.separator</a>
constant (which will contain the relevant character for the platform that the code is currently running on).

Note that if you encounter a tab file with invalid formatting when reading in data from the filesystem, your file parsing method should 
throw an `IOException`. You should however ensure that this exception is subsequently caught by another part of your server - remember:
don't let your server crash !
