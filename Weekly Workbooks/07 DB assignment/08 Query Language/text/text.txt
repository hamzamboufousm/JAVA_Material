Now that we have a communication mechanism in place, we need something to transmit !
Clients will communicate with the server using a simplified version of the SQL database query language.
Your task is to write a handler for the incoming messages which will: parse the incoming command, perform the specified query, update the data stored in the database and return an appropriate result to the client.
Be sure to save any changed data back to the file system - you don't want to risk losing any in-memory updates (in the case where your server crashes, or is kill off).

The query language we will use for this assignment supports the following queries:

- USE: switches the database against which the following queries will be run
- CREATE: constructs a new database or table (depending on the provided parameters)
- INSERT: adds a new record (row) to an existing table
- SELECT: searches for records that match the given condition
- UPDATE: changes the existing data contained within a table
- ALTER: changes the structure (columns) of an existing table
- DELETE: removes records that match the given condition from an existing table
- DROP: removes a specified table from a database, or removes the entire database
- JOIN: performs an **inner** join on two tables (returning all permutations of all matching records)

A grammar that fully defines the simplified query language is provided in <a href="resources/BNF.txt" target="_blank">this BNF document</a>. You will note that BNF grammar contains two distinct types of rule:
- Symbols with angle brackets `<name>` denote rules which MAY contain arbitrary additional whitespace 
- Symbols with square brackets `[name]` indicate rules that can NOT contain additional whitespace

As a consequence of these rules, your server should be able to correctly parse incoming commands irrespective of the number of _additional_ whitespace
characters between certain tokens. So for example: 
<pre>SELECT    *  FROM     people  WHERE   Name  ==  'Steve' ;</pre>
is valid and acceptable, being equivalent to:
<pre>SELECT * FROM people WHERE Name=='Steve';</pre>

Dealing the such additional whitespace might seem like a daunting and challenging task.
Don't panic, we will provide you some help and advice for dealing with such queries.
