In order to check that your code is successfully reading and writing data from the files,
you should alter the data _whilst it is in memory_ (i.e. _after_ you have read it in but _before_ you write it back out again).
You could for example increment the age of all people in the table by one year each time the data is loaded. 
By changing the data in this way, you can check to make sure that the stored files are actually being re-written with the updated information !
