<h2 id="db-assignment">DB assignment</h2>
<h3 id="task-1-introduction">Task 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>This workbook will lead you through the first assessed exercise, the
aim of which is to build a database server (from the ground up !). This
will not only give you more practice writing complex Java programmes,
but will also provide you with hands-on experience of using query
languages. Note that this assignment WILL contribute to your unit mark
(with a weighting of 40%).</p>
<p>The assignment will be marked on the lab machines, so it is essential
that you check that you can compile and run your code using Maven on
these machines before submission.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to discuss assignments and possible solutions with
other students. HOWEVER it is <strong>essential</strong> that you only
submit your own work. This may feel like a grey area, however if you
adhere to the following advice, you should not go far wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don’t take segments of code from existing solutions (e.g. those
found online)</li>
<li>Don’t paste segments of code generated by AI tools into your
work</li>
<li>Never exchange code with other students (via IM/email, GIT, forums,
printouts, photos or any other means)</li>
<li>You should avoid the use of pair programming on this unit - you must
produce all your own work !</li>
<li>It is OK to seek help from online sources (e.g. Stack Overflow) but
don’t just cut-and-paste chunks of code</li>
<li>If you don’t understand what a line of code actually does, you
shouldn’t be submitting it !</li>
<li>Don’t submit anything you couldn’t re-implement under exam
conditions (with a good textbook !)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you ask a question on the unit discussion forum, try to keep
discussion at a high level (i.e. not pasting in chunks of your code). If
it is unavoidable to include code, only share small snippets of the
essential sections you need assistance with.</p>
<p>Automated plagiarism detection tools will be used to flag any
incidences of possible plagiarism. If the markers feel that intentional
plagiarism has actually taken place, the incident will be reported to
the school or faculty plagiarism panel. This may result in a mark of
zero for the assignment, or even the entire unit (if it is a repeat
offence). Don’t panic - if you stick to the above list of advice, you
should remain safe !</p>
<h1 id="section"></h1>
<h3 id="task-2-assignment-overview">Task 2: Assignment Overview</h3>
<p>In this assignment, you will build a relational database server from
scratch. This server must receive incoming requests (conforming to a
standard query language) and then interrogate and manipulate a set of
stored records. Your server will maintain persistent data as a number of
files on your filesystem. You will not be required to implement a client
application - this will be provided for you (to allow you to connect to
your server and check that is it working correctly).</p>
<p>As usual, you have been provided with a
<a href="resources/cw-db" target="_blank">Maven project</a> to help get
you started with the assignment. As before, there is a
<a href="resources/cw-db/src/test/java/edu/uob/ExampleDBTests.java" target="_blank">template
test script</a> for you to use - make sure you add suitable test cases
to this script to ensure that your application is fully and
systematically tested.</p>
<p>It is <strong>essential</strong> that your server is <em>robust</em>
- you should detect and trap errors effectively and ensure that the
server continues running at all times. Just imagine a world in which
servers had to be manually restarted every time something unexpected was
encountered. It’s going to be very difficult for your server to pass the
marking tests if it has crashed !</p>
<p>Note that your main class MUST be called <code>DBServer</code> and
MUST include the following constructor method and input handling
method:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>public DBServer()</code></li>
<li><code>public String handleCommand(String)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If you change the name of the class or the signature of either of the
above methods, we won’t be able to run your code ! We will be using
automated marking scripts and if you server does not conform to the
above, we won’t be able to test it ! Your submission will be assessed on
the success with which it implements the described query language, as
well as the flexibility, error handling and robustness with which your
server operates. Remember that we also care about “Code Quality” - so be
sure to adhere to the coding standards and conventions covered in the
lectures.</p>
<h1 id="section-1"></h1>
<h3 id="task-3-github-repository">Task 3: GitHub Repository</h3>
<p>A key principle of Agile is early and regular delivery of value to
the client, through the steady implementation and delivery of features.
The emphasis is very much on “steady and sustainable development” - no
“all-nighters”, no “heroic effort”. Doing most of the work just before
the deadline is just not the Agile way !</p>
<p>It is important that you have experience of working with an Agile
ethos. For this reason, you will be assessed on the “Agileness” of your
development process. Your aim is to achieve the steady build up of
features over the entire duration of the assignment. We are well aware
that it can take some time to get the foundations of your project built
(i.e. the core structural design, upon which features can then be
build). We therefore don’t expect a lot of features to be achieved in
the first phase of the project. Once the structure of your project is
established however, we would expect to see a steady build-up of
successfully implemented features.</p>
<p>In order for us to gain insight into your development process, you
should maintain your codebase in a GitHub repository. Perhaps the
easiest way to create a new repository is via the GitHub website: click
on the green “New” button and enter details as outlined in
<a href="resources/new-repo-settings.jpg" target="_blank">this
screenshot</a>. Note that you should select your own GitHub account as
the “owner”. Give the repository the name <code>JAVA-CW-2023</code> so
that we can identify your Java coursework repository easily. You should
also be sure to make your repository private (so that other students
don’t have access to your code !). Once created, you can clone the
repository to your local computer. This should create a folder called
<code>JAVA-CW-2023</code>, which you can then drop your
<code>cw-db</code> project folder into.</p>
<p>So that we may assess your work, you should invite the lecturers to
join your repository. The easiest way to do this is to go to the web
page for your new repo, then select
<code>Settings &gt; Collaborators &gt; Add People</code> and enter the
username <code>sl17668</code>. To check that you have added the correct
user, the profile picture for this account should be a purple triangle !
If you haven’t invited us to your repo, then we won’t be able to mark
your work, so you will get an automatic zero for this assignment !</p>
<p>At this stage, you should also add your University of Bristol
username to the main page of your repository. Edit the README file,
adding your UoB username - put it inside square brackets (for example
<code>[ab12345]</code>) so that it is easily identifiable. Make sure you
add all of the <em>appropriate</em> project files (files you want to
appear on GitHub !) to your list of tracked files (using
<code>git add ...</code>). You should commit and push to your repo on a
regular basis - at the end of every coding session (“before you eat or
sleep” is a good principle). You should practice continuous integration:
always keep your master branch operational. It should be possible to
clone the master branch of your repository and be able to compile and
run the server via maven (without any kind of editing or copying of
additional files) even if there are features which haven’t yet been
implemented !</p>
<p>In addition to functionality, robustness and flexibility of your
implemented solution, you will also be assessed on the frequency and
regularity of committing working features to your repository. We will be
taking into consideration the “steadiness” of the accumulation of
implemented features. Your aim is to achieve a pattern of implementation
as shown in the left-hand figure below (and avoid the situation
illustrated in the right-hand graph !). Note that you should also be
careful to adhere to the guidelines on <em>what</em> to push to your
repository - only appropriate content should appear on GitHub (no
duplicates, no built resources, no stored data etc). You will need to
employ a suitable <code>.gitignore</code> file to assist with this
task.</p>

<img src="../../resources/icons/video.png" /> </a></p>
<p>Any database system must be able to persistently store data
(otherwise it will lose everything each time it is restarted). In this
assignment, you must use the file system for this purpose. Your database
will consist of a number of tables (aka ‘entities’), each containing a
collection of rows that store ‘records’ - see the table shown later in
this section for an example.</p>
<p>Each table should be stored in a separate file using tab separated
text. A <a href="resources/people.tab" target="_blank">sample data
file</a> has been provided to illustrate this file format. Note that the
constructor method of the <code>DBServer</code> class in the template
project initialises a <code>storageFolderPath</code> variable to
indicate which folder should be used to store the data files. This
variable has been set to a folder called <code>databases</code> - it is
essential that you store ALL of your data inside this directory (and
nowhere else outside of it).</p>
<p>The first (0th) column in each table must contain a unique numerical
identifier or ‘primary key’ (which should always be called
<code>id</code>). The <code>id</code> value of each row will NOT be
provided by the user, but rather they should be automatically generated
by the server. It is up to you how you do this, however you should
ensure that each <code>id</code> is unique (within the table where is
resides).</p>
<p>Both Database names and Table names should be case insensitive (since
some file systems have problems differentiating between upper and lower
case filenames). Any database/table names provided by the user should be
converted into lowercase before saving out to the filesystem. You should
treat column names as case insensitive for querying, but you should
<em>preserve</em> the case when storing them (i.e. do NOT convert them
to lower case). This is so that the user can define attribute names
using CamelCase if they wish (which is a useful aid to readability).</p>
<p><img src="04%20Persistent%20Storage/images/table.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
As a useful starting point, your first task is to write a method that
reads in the data from the
<a href="resources/people.tab" target="_blank">sample data file</a>
using the Java File IO API. View the slides and video at the start of
this section for an overview of these packages. At this stage you need
only print out the content of these records to the terminal (in a later
task you will store this data in a suitable data structure). You may
need to delve more deeply into the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/io/package-summary.html" target="_blank">File
IO documentation</a> in order to implement your ideas.</p>
<p>When working with file paths, it is <strong>essential</strong> that
you do not use any platform-specific file separators. Some platforms use
<code>\</code> and some platforms use <code>/</code> for separating
folder names in a file path. Java code should work on ALL platforms -
for this reason, you should make use of the
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/io/File.html#separator" target="_blank">File.separator</a>
constant (which will contain the relevant character for the platform
that the code is currently running on).</p>
<p>Note that if you encounter a tab file with invalid formatting when
reading in data from the filesystem, your file parsing method should
throw an <code>IOException</code>. You should however ensure that this
exception is subsequently caught by another part of your server -
remember: don’t let your server crash !</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-maintaining-relationships">Task 5: Maintaining
Relationships</h3>
<p>Relationships between records in different tables should be recorded
using ‘foreign keys’. For example, the <code>PurchaserID</code> in the
table illustrated below is a reference to the <code>id</code> of a
person from the example table in the previous task. This additional data
file is <a href="resources/sheds.tab" target="_blank">provided for
you</a> in order to aid you in developing a solution. Note that only
single element keys are in use (i.e. you do not need to cope with
‘composite’ keys).</p>
<p>It is important that the <code>id</code> of a record must NOT change
at any time during the operation of the system (once a record has been
assigned an <code>id</code> this must stay fixed for as long as that
record is kept in the database). Additionally, you should not “recycle”
the IDs in any table (i.e. reusing the IDs for new rows after old rows
have been deleted). This is because the IDs might be used as foreign
keys elsewhere and there is the risk and unintentional relationships are
created.</p>
<p>For simplicity, no primary or foreign key marker keywords are
provided in the query language - the server relies upon programmer
remembering which attributes are keys.</p>
<p>It is <em>not</em> your responsibility to normalise the database -
this is a job for the developers who have designed the database schema
and who make use of your database server. If you don’t know what
normalisation is, then don’t worry - you don’t need to know for this
assignment.</p>
<p><img src="05%20Maintaining%20Relationships/images/sheds.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-java-data-structures">Task 6: Java Data Structures</h3>
<p>Once the data has been read in from the filesystem, you will need to
store it in memory. You will need to devise a suitable set of classes to
represent this data inside your Java program. Think carefully about the
tabular nature of relational databases and then write a set of classes
that match this structure. You will need to consider a wide range of
different elements of the database, including: tables, rows, columns,
keys, table names, column names, data values, ids and relationships
between entities.</p>
<p>Remember that this teaching block focuses on “development” (not just
“coding”) and as such we are attempting to develop your analysis and
design skills. This exercise is more than just implementing a
pre-defined specification - it requires you to understand the domain, be
able to deconstruct the problem and make informed design decisions to
achieve a successful solution. As such, it is not easy - you are likely
to make mistakes and will need to refactor your code at different stages
over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Once you have defined a collection of classes that you feel are
appropriate to the problem, use the file reading methods that you wrote
in the previous section to populate instances of your classes with data
read in from the sample data files. In order to fully exercise your
classes as you develop your server further, you will need to write
additional data files to augment those given to you. We advise creating
these data files using queries in your testing scripts, rather than
manually writing them. This is because you are likely to need to
recreate them on a regular basis during the course of your development
work. Additionally, you should not write any test scripts that assume
the presence of pre-existing tab files, since there is no guarantee that
these will be present in the <code>databases</code> folder !</p>
<p>Once you have successfully stored the imported data in your classes,
the next step is to write a method to save these structures <em>back
out</em> to the filesystem again (using appropriate features of the Java
File API).</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
In order to check that your code is successfully reading and writing
data from the files, you should alter the data <em>whilst it is in
memory</em> (i.e. <em>after</em> you have read it in but <em>before</em>
you write it back out again). You could for example increment the age of
all people in the table by one year each time the data is loaded. By
changing the data in this way, you can check to make sure that the
stored files are actually being re-written with the updated information
!</p>
<h1 id="section-5"></h1>
<h3 id="task-7-communication">Task 7: Communication</h3>
<p>It is not the aim of this assignment to address the topic of network
or socket programming. For this reason, the networking aspects of the
server have been provided for you in
<a href="resources/cw-db/src/main/java/edu/uob/DBServer.java" target="_blank">the
template server class</a>. This server can be run from the command line
using <code>mvnw exec:java@server</code>.</p>
<p>The database server listens on port <code>8888</code> in order to
receive incoming messages. These incoming commands are then passed to
the <code>handleCommand</code> method for processing. Your task is to
add to the <code>handleCommand</code> method to respond to the commands.
To start with, do not attempt to interpret the content of the incoming
messages, just respond with the content of <em>all</em> of the tables
currently in your database (irrespective of what the incoming message
contained).</p>
<p>It is up to you how you format the printing of the table content. You
should however attempt to make the response as human-reader-friendly as
possible. You will see from the sample test script provided in the
template project that the tests have been written using simple word
matching. This has been done because output formatting will vary from
implementation to implementation and the test cases need to work with
all students’ code. You should use the same approach when writing your
own tests.</p>
<p>It is essential that your response is returned by the
<code>handleCommand</code> method and NOT just printed out in the local
terminal/console. When we test your server during the marking process,
we will be monitoring what is returned via the network. You won’t get
any marks for just doing <code>println</code> messages in the terminal
!</p>
<p>To help you ensure that your server conforms to the correct protocol,
a
<a href="resources/cw-db/src/main/java/edu/uob/DBClient.java" target="_blank">command-line
client</a> has been provided for you. This client can be run from the
command line using <code>mvnw exec:java@client</code>. You should not
change any of the code in the client - any features that you implement
in this class will not be executed during the marking process. The
client has been provided purely to allow you to manually check that your
server is operating correctly. During the marking process, your server
will be marked entirely by automated test scripts.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, you may assume only a single client
connects to the server at any one time. (i.e. there is no need to handle
parallel queries or deal with issues of contention).</p>
<h1 id="section-6"></h1>
<h3 id="task-8-query-language">Task 8: Query Language</h3>
<p>Now that we have a communication mechanism in place, we need
something to transmit ! Clients will communicate with the server using a
simplified version of the SQL database query language. Your task is to
write a handler for the incoming messages which will: parse the incoming
command, perform the specified query, update the data stored in the
database and return an appropriate result to the client. Be sure to save
any changed data back to the file system - you don’t want to risk losing
any in-memory updates (in the case where your server crashes, or is kill
off).</p>
<p>The query language we will use for this assignment supports the
following queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>USE: switches the database against which the following queries will
be run</li>
<li>CREATE: constructs a new database or table (depending on the
provided parameters)</li>
<li>INSERT: adds a new record (row) to an existing table</li>
<li>SELECT: searches for records that match the given condition</li>
<li>UPDATE: changes the existing data contained within a table</li>
<li>ALTER: changes the structure (columns) of an existing table</li>
<li>DELETE: removes records that match the given condition from an
existing table</li>
<li>DROP: removes a specified table from a database, or removes the
entire database</li>
<li>JOIN: performs an <strong>inner</strong> join on two tables
(returning all permutations of all matching records)</li>
</ul>
<p>A grammar that fully defines the simplified query language is
provided in <a href="resources/BNF.txt" target="_blank">this BNF
document</a>. You will note that BNF grammar contains two distinct types
of rule: - Symbols with angle brackets <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> denote
rules which MAY contain arbitrary additional whitespace - Symbols with
square brackets <code>[name]</code> indicate rules that can NOT contain
additional whitespace</p>
As a consequence of these rules, your server should be able to correctly
parse incoming commands irrespective of the number of
<em>additional</em> whitespace characters between certain tokens. So for
example:
<pre>SELECT    *  FROM     people  WHERE   Name  ==  'Steve' ;</pre>
is valid and acceptable, being equivalent to:
<pre>SELECT * FROM people WHERE Name=='Steve';</pre>
<p>Dealing the such additional whitespace might seem like a daunting and
challenging task. Don’t panic, we will provide you some help and advice
for dealing with such queries.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Note that you should NOT use any existing parsers or parser generators
(Yacc, Lex, Antlr etc.) The aim of this assignment is to implement the
command parsing using your own code.</p>
<p>To help further illustrate the use of the simplified query language,
we have provided
<a href="resources/example-transcript.docx" target="_blank">a transcript
of example queries</a>.</p>

<p>This section provides more detail regarding the intended operation of
the database server.</p>
<h4 id="sql-keywords"><em>SQL keywords</em></h4>
<p>Convention has it that query examples are typically shown with
uppercase keywords (to differentiate them from identifiers and
literals). However, SQL keywords are in fact case insensitive, so
<code>select * from people;</code> is equivalent to
<code>SELECT * FROM people;</code>. This is true for all keywords in the
BNF (including <code>TRUE</code>/<code>FALSE</code>,
<code>AND</code>/<code>OR</code>, <code>LIKE</code> etc.) In addition to
this, all SQL keywords are reserved words, therefore you should not
allow them to be used as database/table/attribute names. The server
should return an error if the user attempts to misuse a reserved keyword
(see next task for details of error handling).</p>
<h4 id="comparisons"><em>Comparisons</em></h4>
<p>It is not necessary to implement a datatype system within the
database - you can just store everything as simple text strings. You
should perform <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
<code>&lt;=</code> comparisons wherever it is possible to do something
sensible (e.g. with floats, ints, strings etc). In situations where no
appropriate comparison is possible (e.g. <code>firstName &gt; 12</code>)
don’t try to trap the query and return an error, just return no data in
the results table. The <code>LIKE</code> comparator is intended just for
use with strings and provides a simple case sensitive substring matcher
(NOT the full SQL <code>LIKE</code> operator with % wildcarding). If the
user attempts to perform a <code>LIKE</code> query on non-string data
(e.g. ints, floats, booleans) your server should not return an error,
but just perform the query as though the data were a string (even if
this causes some strange results).</p>
<h4 id="join-attribute-ordering"><em>JOIN Attribute Ordering</em></h4>
<p>Table attributes of our simplified query language are “unqualified”
(i.e. they do not include the name of the table within which they
exist). When performing a <code>JOIN</code> query therefore, we must
ensure that the ordering of the specified tables is the same as the
ordering of the specified attributes. For example, a query should be of
the form:
<code>JOIN tableOne AND tableTwo ON attributeFromTableOne AND attributeFromTableTwo;</code>
Enforcing this ordering makes it possible for your server to easily
identify the specific attributes referred to by a query.</p>
<h4 id="response-tables"><em>Response tables</em></h4>
<p>The order of values returned by a <code>SELECT</code> should be the
same as specified in the query
(e.g. <code>SELECT name, id FROM marks</code> would return the
<code>name</code> column first, followed by the <code>id</code> column).
Note that <code>SELECT *</code> should return the values in the order
that they are stored in the table. The table returned by a
<code>JOIN</code> should contain attribute names in the form
<code>OriginalTableName.AttributeName</code> (see the
<a href="resources/example-transcript.docx" target="_blank">query
transcript</a> for specific examples). This is so the user can determine
which attributes came from which tables (as well as coping with the
situation where two tables have attributes of the same name). Note that
these composite names are purely for the display of the tables -
attribute names containing <code>.</code> characters are not permitted
by the BNF and are therefore not valid for use in queries. The joined
table should NOT contain the ID columns from the original tables, but
rather should include a new ID column containing freshly generated
IDs.</p>
<h1 id="section-8"></h1>
<h3 id="task-10-error-handling">Task 10: Error Handling</h3>
<p>Your query interpreter should identify any errors in the structure
and content of incoming queries. The response returned from your server
back to the client must begin with one of the following two “status”
tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[OK]</code> for valid and successful queries, followed by the
results of the query.</li>
<li><code>[ERROR]</code> if the query is invalid, followed by a suitable
human-readable message that provides information about the nature of the
error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Errors should be returned to the client if the SQL is malformed
(i.e. doesn’t conform to the BNF) or when the user attempts to perform
prohibited actions, including (but not limited to): - trying to insert
too many (or too few) values into a table entry - attempting to create a
database or table using a name that already exists - creating a table
with duplicate column names (or trying to add a column with an existing
name) - attempting to remove the ID column from a table - changing
(updating) the ID of a record - queries on non-existent databases,
tables and columns - queries which use invalid element names
(e.g. reserved SQL keywords)</p>
<p>Errors should NOT be returned in situations where the user performs:
- a valid query that has no matches: just return the column names and no
data rows - a query to delete columns/tables/rows/database that contain
data: the user should be free to perform destructive actions - a
comparison of two different data types: attempt a sensible comparison if
possible, return blank results if not</p>
<p>Note that because you are not required to maintain type information
for the attributes in a table, it will not be possible for you to
validate the type of inserted data. It is therefore the responsibility
of the user to ensure that only numerical data is stored in numerical
attributes and string data is stored in string attributes etc.</p>
<p>You may wish to make use of exceptions to handle errors internally
within your server, however these should NOT be returned to the client.
Java exceptions are for the benefit of Java programmers - they are not
intended for use as user error messages. It is essential that your
response back to the client begins with the correct status tag (either
<code>[OK]</code> or <code>[ERROR]</code>). These will be used by the
automated testing scripts during the marking process !</p>

<h3 id="task-11-final-submission">Task 11: Final Submission</h3>
<p>The university requires a timestamped submission of the final version
of your work to be submitted via Blackboard. You should therefore create
a zip archive of your entire Maven project (the <code>cw-db</code>
folder) and upload this via the
<code>Assessment, submission and feedback</code> section on this unit’s
Blackboard page. It is essential that you ensure your code compiles and
runs on the lab machines using <code>mvnw</code> before you submit
it.</p>
<p>Your submission will be assessed on the success with which it
implements the described query language, as well as the flexibility and
robustness with which it operates. You should make sure your code can
respond to <em>at the very least</em> the “standard” query spacing (as
illustrated in the
<a href="resources/example-transcript.docx" target="_blank">example
transcript</a>). As with any real implementation of SQL, you should also
however support variability of whitespace. Remember that different users
may use different spacing standards and styles - it is desirable to
support them, not constrain them !</p>
<p>Make sure that your code does not contain anything specific to your
computer or platform (e.g. absolute file paths, operating system
specific code etc). Before submitting your code, we advise your to test
your project on a computer <em>other than the one it was developed
on</em>. If you developed your code on your own computer, make sure it
operates correctly on the lab machines. If you developed your code on
the lab machines, make sure it operates correctly on another platform
(e.g. ideally a Windows computer - if you have access to one). Clear out
all files from the <code>databases</code> folder and then ensure the
code compiles and runs correctly with Maven (using:
<code>mvnw clean compile test</code>). We will apply a penalty mark if
we cannot run your code “out of the box” - we can’t spend time “fixing”
everyones projects before we mark them !</p>
<p>It is VERY important that you do NOT change the name or parameters of
any of the classes and methods that you have been given. Scripts will be
used to automatically run your code to make sure it operates correctly -
if you rename somethings you shouldn’t, we won’t be able to mark your
code ! Your main class MUST be called <code>DBServer</code> and should
not change the signature of the constructor or the
<code>handleCommand</code> method. It is <strong>ESSENTIAL</strong> that
you check your code passes the original skeleton test script - if it
does not pass these basic tests then your code will not pass any of the
marking test scripts.</p>
<p>Remember that this unit is not just about assessing the operation of
executable code - we are also interested in wider “development” issues.
Remember that your submission will be assessed on “code quality” as
outlined in the lectures. Finally, remember that we are interested in
your <em>process</em> as well as the <em>final product</em> - for this
reason, we will be exploring your GitHub repository during the marking
process.</p>
