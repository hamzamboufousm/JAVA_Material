Relationships between records in different tables should be recorded using 'foreign keys'.
For example, the `PurchaserID` in the table illustrated below is a reference to the `id` of a person from the example table in the previous task.
This additional data file is <a href="resources/sheds.tab" target="_blank">provided for you</a> in order to aid you in developing a solution.
Note that only single element keys are in use (i.e. you do not need to cope with 'composite' keys).

It is important that the `id` of a record must NOT change at any time during the operation of the system
(once a record has been assigned an `id` this must stay fixed for as long as that record is kept in the database).
Additionally, you should not "recycle" the IDs in any table (i.e. reusing the IDs for new rows after old rows have been deleted).
This is because the IDs might be used as foreign keys elsewhere and there is the risk and unintentional relationships are created.

For simplicity, no primary or foreign key marker keywords are provided in the query language - the server relies upon programmer remembering which attributes are keys.

It is _not_ your responsibility to normalise the database - this is a job for the developers who have designed the database schema and who make use of your database server. If you don't know what normalisation is, then don't worry - you don't need to know for this assignment.
